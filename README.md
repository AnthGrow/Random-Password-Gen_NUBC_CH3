"Click" the red "Generate Password" button.  This will prompt an alert asking the user to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters.  Upon supplying a number, the user is then prompted four more times, given options for determining if they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special charcters included in their password.  Upon selecting "ok" or "cancel" in place of booleans "True" and "False" the user makese these decisions and results in their random password being generated and populated to the textarea in place of the words "Your Secure Password."
